## Styling Text and Fonts in CSS

CSS provides a rich set of properties for controlling the appearance of text and fonts on web pages. Here are some key properties and an example demonstrating their usage:

## Properties

- font-family: Specifies the font family to be used for the text.
- font-size: Sets the size of the text.
- font-weight: Controls the boldness of the text (e.g., normal, bold, bolder, lighter).
- text-align: Aligns the text within its container (e.g., left, center, right, justify).
- color: Sets the color of the text.
- text-decoration: Applies decorations to text (e.g., underline, line-through, overline).
- text-transform: Converts text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize each word.

In gemini.html:

- The h1 element uses the Arial font family, has a font size of 36 pixels, is bold, and is centered.
- The p elements use the Verdana font family, have a font size of 18 pixels, and are colored #444444.
- The a elements have no text decoration by default but underline when hovered over.

#### Additional Tips

- Font Stacks: To ensure cross-browser compatibility, use font stacks. This provides fallback fonts if the primary font is not available on the user's system.
- Relative Units: Use relative units like em or rem for font sizes to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
- CSS Frameworks: Consider using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation for pre-defined styles and components, which can save time and effort.
- Typography Tools: Explore tools like Google Fonts or Typekit to access a wide range of fonts and easily integrate them into your projects.

By understanding and applying these CSS properties, you can effectively customize the appearance of text and fonts on your web pages to create visually appealing and readable content.
