## Flexbox Layout Model

Flexbox is a CSS layout model designed to make it easier to create flexible and responsive web layouts. It provides a one-dimensional layout model, meaning items are arranged in a single row or column. Flexbox is particularly useful for creating responsive layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes.

- **Key Concepts**:
    - Flex Container: The parent element that establishes the flexbox layout.
    - Flex Items: The child elements within the flex container.
    - Flex Axis: The direction in which flex items are arranged (horizontal or vertical).
    - Cross Axis: The axis perpendicular to the flex axis.

- **Properties**:
    - **flex-direction**: Controls the direction of the flex items (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
    - **justify-content**: Aligns flex items along the main axis.
        - flex-start: Items align to the start of the container.
        - flex-end: Items align to the end of the container.
        - center: Items are centered within the container.
        - space-between: Items are distributed evenly with spaces between them.
        - space-around: Items are distributed evenly with spaces around them.

    - **align-items**: Aligns flex items along the cross axis.
        - flex-start: Items align to the start of the cross axis.
        - flex-end: Items align to the end of the cross axis.
        - center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
        - stretch: Items are stretched to fill the cross axis. Â  
        - flex-wrap: Controls whether flex items wrap to a new line when the container is too small.
        - nowrap: Items do not wrap.
        - wrap: Items wrap to a new line.
        - wrap-reverse: Items wrap to a new line in reverse order.

## Flexbox Layout Model Overview

The Flexbox layout model in CSS is a powerful tool for creating flexible and responsive web layouts. Unlike traditional CSS layout techniques (such as floats or positioning), Flexbox allows elements within a container to automatically align, distribute space, and adjust their size according to the available space. This makes it especially useful for building responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

Key Features of Flexbox:
- Flex Containers and Flex Items: A container becomes a flex container when you apply the display: flex; property. All direct children of that container become flex items.
- Axis-based alignment: Flexbox operates along two axes:
    - The main axis (determined by the flex-direction property)
    - The cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis)
- Automatic adjustment: Flex items adjust their size and positioning based on the available space.

Key Flexbox Properties and Their Effects
1. **flex-direction**: Defines the direction in which the flex items are placed.
    - row (default): Items are placed in a row (left to right).
    - column: Items are placed in a column (top to bottom).
    - Example: flex-direction: column;
    
2. **justify-content**: Aligns items along the main axis (horizontal by default if flex-direction is row).
    - flex-start: Aligns items to the start of the container.
    - center: Centers items along the main axis.
    - space-between: Distributes items with space between them.
    - Example: justify-content: space-between;

3. **align-items**: Aligns items along the cross axis (vertical by default if flex-direction is row).
    - flex-start: Aligns items to the start of the cross axis.
    - center: Centers items along the cross axis.
    - stretch: Stretches items to fill the container.
    - Example: align-items: center;

4. **flex-wrap**: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines, which is important for responsive designs.
    - nowrap: All items are placed on one line (default).
    - wrap: Items wrap onto multiple lines if necessary.
    - Example: flex-wrap: wrap;

5. **flex-basis**, flex-grow, and flex-shrink: Control how items grow, shrink, and what their base size is.
    - flex-basis: The initial size of a flex item.
    - flex-grow: Determines how much a flex item will grow relative to others.
    - flex-shrink: Determines how much a flex item will shrink relative to others.
