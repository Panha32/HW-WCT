## CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

CSS variables, also known as custom properties, are a powerful feature introduced in CSS3 that allows you to define and reuse values throughout your stylesheet. They provide a dynamic way to manage styles and maintain consistency across different components of your website.

How CSS Variables Work
1. **Define Variables**: You use the -- prefix to define a custom property. For example, --primary-color: #007bff;.
2. **Reference Variables**: You can reference the variable within other CSS properties using the var() function. For example, color: var(--primary-color);.
3. **Update Values**: To change the value of a variable, simply redefine it. This will automatically update all elements that reference it.

Benefits of Using CSS Variables
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent styling throughout your website by centralizing color, font, and other style values.
- **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to update styles globally by modifying a single variable.
- **Themeability**: Allows you to create different themes by changing the values of variables.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Can be combined with JavaScript to create dynamic styles based on user interactions or data.

## CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow developers to define reusable values that can be applied throughout the stylesheet. These variables provide an easy way to maintain consistency, reduce repetition, and simplify maintenance, especially when working with large and complex stylesheets.

- **Syntax for Defining and Using CSS Variables**:
    1. **Defining Variables**: CSS variables are defined using the -- prefix, usually within a :root selector to make them globally accessible across the document.
    2. **Using Variables**: To use a CSS variable, you reference it with the var() function.

Benefits of CSS Variables:
- **Consistency**: Changes to a variable affect all elements using it, ensuring consistent styling.
- **Reusability**: You can reuse the same values in multiple places, reducing repetition.
- **Dynamic updates**: You can easily update variables using media queries, JavaScript, or even based on user interaction.

## Effects of Changing CSS Variables

- When the values of the variables are modified (e.g., in a media query or dynamically via JavaScript), all the elements that use those variables are updated automatically.
- In the chatgpt.html, when the screen width is smaller than 768px, the colors and sizes change based on the updated variable values, demonstrating how flexible and powerful CSS variables are in maintaining consistency and responsiveness.
