## CSS Selectors:

In CSS, selectors are used to target specific elements in an HTML document and apply styles to them. They act as a way to identify and address elements based on their name, class, ID, attributes, or other criteria.

## How CSS Selectors Work:

<ol>
    <li>Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specific type. For example, p targets all paragraph elements, and h1 targets all heading level 1 elements.
    </li>
    <li>Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute. The class attribute is defined within the opening tag of an element and is preceded by a dot (.). For example, .my-class targets all elements with the class attribute "my-class".
    </li>
    <li>ID Selector: Targets a single element with a unique ID attribute. The ID attribute is also defined within the opening tag of an element and is preceded by a pound sign (#). For example, #my-id targets the element with the ID attribute "my-id".</li>
    <li>
        Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes. Various attribute selectors can be used, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>
                [attribute] targets elements with the specified attribute, regardless of its value.
            </li>
            <li>
                [attribute=value] targets elements with the specified attribute and value.
            </li>
            <li>
                [attribute^=value] targets elements with the specified attribute starting with the given value.
            </li>
            <li>
                [attribute$=value] targets elements with the specified attribute ending with the given value.
            </li>
            <li>
                [attribute*=value] targets elements with the specified attribute containing the given value.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Pseudo-Class Selector: Targets elements based on their state or condition. Examples include :hover (targeting elements when the mouse hovers over them), :active (targeting elements when they are clicked or tapped), and :focus (targeting elements when they have keyboard focus).
    </li>
</ol>

## CSS Selectors:

CSS Selectors are patterns used to select and style specific elements in an HTML document. There are different types of CSS selectors, such as element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-class selectors. 

<ol>
    <li>
        Element Selector: This targets all instances of a specific HTML element. For example, p targets all p elements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Class Selector: This targets elements that have a specific class attribute. You use a . followed by the class name (e.g., .myClass).
    </li>
    <li>
        ID Selector: This targets a single element with a specific ID. You use a # followed by the ID name (e.g., #myID).
    </li>
    <li>
        Attribute Selector: This targets elements that have a specific attribute, regardless of its value or based on specific conditions. You use square brackets (e.g., [type="text"]).
    </li>
    <li>
        Pseudo-Class Selector: This applies styles to elements based on their state or position, like :hover (when hovering over an element), or :nth-child(n) (targeting specific children).
    </li>
</ol>
